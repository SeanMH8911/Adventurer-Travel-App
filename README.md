# Music-Genie

Music genie was built using HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, Spotfiy API and Google Map API. The wirefram was created using Figma.

The user can search for their favourite musical artist, which will present them will a variety of results inlcuding Artist information and biography, Albums and singles. A user can also find upcoming concerts with details of the venue, along with a map overview, which is represented by a marker.

Each artist has a favourite button, when selected it will add your favourite artist to your favourite page using local storage. To give the user a friendly feel when visiting the page, They can add their name and each time they return they will be welcomed.
